The widower made a present transfer of the property to his niece by physically handing over the deed to his friend, who acted as his agent. This transfer was effective even if the niece was in Africa and unaware of it. When the friend recorded the deed with the Recorder's Office, it became a valid transfer of ownership.

One approach involves finding the interval corresponding to the middle 100,000 riders, while the other involves finding the interval that contains the middle 50% of the riders and then splitting that in half.\n\nBased on the wording of the question, we need to find the shortest time interval associated with 100,000 riders. This suggests that we should use the first approach, which directly aims to find the range of waiting times that includes the middle 100,000 riders.\n\nUsing the normal distribution and finding the z-score associated with the 100,000th rider, we get a z-score of -5.

Since the minimal polynomial of P also has only 0's and 1's as roots, each block must have size 1 or 0, and the nonzero blocks must correspond to distinct eigenvectors of P with eigenvalue 1. Therefore, P is diagonalizable with eigenvalues 0 and 1 if and only if it is similar to a diagonal matrix with some number (possibly 0 or dim(V)) of 1's along the diagonal, and 0's elsewhere.
