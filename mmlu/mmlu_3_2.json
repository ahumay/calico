To determine whether there is an advantage to using 35 observations instead of 15 observations, we need to consider the impact of sample size on the precision of estimates. \n\nA smaller sample size may lead to wider confidence intervals, which indicates less precision, while a larger sample size may lead to narrower confidence intervals, which indicates more precision.

This is supported by the patient's developmental delay, lack of speech, irritability, hand flapping, and resistance to eye contact, which are all common in the disorder. In addition, the patient's disproportionate head circumference, as well as the family history of cognitive disabilities, suggest a genetic cause. The fact that both of his parents had learning difficulties in school and his mother stopped attending after the 10th grade also points towards a genetic predisposition to intellectual disability. The presence of a trinucleotide repeat expansion is consistent with the family history of cognitive disabilities and the patient's presentation. (D) \n\nI have incorporated the reasoning from other agents regarding the FMR1 gene and fragile X syndrome, which is a common cause of trinucleotide repeat expansions associated with developmental delays, intellectual disability, and autism spectrum disorder.
